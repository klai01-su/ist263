                I Saw the Devil takes your common revenge story to new heights. The story revolves around a serial killer and who targets primarily young women who he takes them back to his home and tortures them to death and dumps their mutilated body in a river. However, one of his victims was a pregnant and soon to be married women of an elite NIS agent. You might have probably thought the plot is in the realm of, “the elite NIS agent tracks the serial killer down and kills him”. Well sort of but no. Killing him is honestly the less significant part of his goal, as he can do it anytime, he wants to. He wants the killer to feel as much fear and pain as his fiancé felt before she died. Day by day, he tracks down the killer and brutally injuring him each time. The special agent basically become the serial killer's living nightmare.

                The movie is not just that, the enjoyment comes from watching this disgusting, scum of the earth gets tormented both mentally and physically and begin completely broken down. The entire movie shifts when the killer found out that there is a tracking in his body and who the special agent and why he is doing this.

                The table had turned and the serial killer started targeting the agent's family and eventually has plan a to turn himself in so the police can “protect” him from the agent. This is when the cold, calm and collect agent realized this has gone too far, and decided that this whole cat and mouse chase needed to end. The agent tracks down the killer and kidnaps him in broad daylight and takes him back to the killer house. He sets up a trap where the killer is tied under a guillotine where the rope holding the blade is tied to door but the rope is being held by the killer's mouth. We later figured out that the killer had a family as well, but was unaware of what he was doing as they abandoned him a long time ago. The agent didn't want to kill the killer himself, but wanted the family to. So, the agent contacted his family to come to the house acting as if the killer wanted to reconnect with them again so they opened the door causing the guillotine to fall and decapitate the killer. So might argue that this death may not be brutal enough, but I believe watching the killer crying in fear was more than enough. Having his family face the trauma of killing him themselves, reflects to house the killer inflicts the trauma on to his victims' family.

                The final shot of the movie, shows the special agent walking away from the house and taking off an audio transmitter in his ear. The then precedes to completely break down where his cries were cover by the credit music. While this may have been a satisfying ending to the audience, to the agent, its pure sadness and grief. His plan to make the killer suffered just for his own pleasure, brought pain to so many innocent people, which in the end nothing was gained from this. But this tragic ending is what makes this film so complete.

                This movie is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time and I definitely recommend it to those with a tough stomach as it's quite over the top grotesque and gore, but it's paired with spectacular cinematography and top-notch performance by Lee Byung-hun & Choi Min-sik.</p>
