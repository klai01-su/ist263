        The film's protagonist, Jong-Goo, a bumbling small-town policeman, finds himself facing a series of bizarre and gruesome murders in his community.

        The uncertainty begins with the very premise of "The Wailing." Is this a supernatural horror film, a psychological thriller, or a social commentary on fear and paranoia? The director masterfully keeps us guessing, refusing to confine the story to one genre, which keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, unsure of what will happen next.

        The uncertain moral landscape of the film further deepens the ambiguity. The characters in "The Wailing" grapple with their own sense of right and wrong as they confront the evil presence that has descended upon their village. Each character is tainted by a shade of darkness, and the boundaries between heroes and villains become indistinct, leaving us to ponder the nature of good and evil.

The eerie landscapes of the village, the foreboding forests, and the dimly lit interiors create an atmosphere of dread and suspense. As viewers, we are uncertain about what lurks in the shadows, what is real, and what is imagined. Every shot adds to the unsettling atmosphere, keeping us perpetually in the dark.
